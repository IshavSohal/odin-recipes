    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
        Forget about ordering Italian sub sandwiches from a restaurant, and start making them 
        at home. They are so quick and easy to make and more budget-friendly. Buy good quality 
        hoagie rolls and deli meats, and get ready for a delicious, homemade sandwich hot out 
        of the oven.

            as desired. Lightly drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar; sprinkle
